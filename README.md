Implementation of a website for a private school

Using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery I implemented the above website. When first loaded on a browser synthetic data are used and then javascript local storage is used, so the data are preserved locally after the browser is closed and until the user clears the storage.
